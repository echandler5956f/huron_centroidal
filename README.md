# Galileo
*A light-weight and extensible C++ library for Guass-Legendre Pseudospectral Collocation of Switched Systems using Casadi and Pinocchio.*

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VQJ3ZNe.png"/>

Named after the famous scientist who posed one variation of the Brachistochrone problem, *Galileo* is an efficient optimal control that uses Gauss-Legendre Pseudospectral Collocation to solve the switched systems problem for legged robots.

Features:  
:heavy_check_mark: Intuitive and efficient formulation of variables, cost and constraints using [casadi].   

:heavy_check_mark: Solver interface nables using the high-performance solvers [Ipopt] and [Snopt].  

:heavy_check_mark: [pinocchio] makes custom robot integration as simple as switching the URDF.

:heavy_check_mark: [ROS]/[catkin] integration (optional).

:heavy_check_mark: Light-weight framework makes it easy to use and extend.

## Install

### From source

1. Install Galileo's mandatory dependencies:
   * [casadi](https://github.com/casadi/casadi)
   * [pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio)
   * [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

2. (optional) Install Galileo's optional dependencies
   * [Ipopt](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt)

3. Clone it, create a build directory inside, and:
   ```bash
   cmake .. && make && make install
   ```

## Run

## Documentation

### Doxygen
Run 
```bash
doxygen
```
in the main directory, and then
```bash
cd docs/html && explorer.exe index.html
```
to view the doxygen output.

## Develop

Right now, our main development goal is to get the framework to solve general trajectory optimization problems with fixed contact sequences in an MPC context. This is essentially the same problem that OCS2 and Crocoddyl solve. Our hope is that using Pseudospectral Collocation will yield faster convergence, and that tha Casadi + Pinocchio pipeline will result in smaller, more digestible code, which is easier to expand upon than the bulky frameworks mentioned prior.

## Contribute

We are a small team of WPI students with no lab and no funding. We are open to contributions from the community! Submit a pull request or post an issue if you have any suggestions. This framework is still in its most nascent phase, and will take time to mature. Be patient and hopefully something good will come from this work.

## Publications

Coming soon (ICRA 2025?).
